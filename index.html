            <article>
                <p>Beyoncé Knowles-Carter was born September 4th, 1981 in Houston, Texas. Her father Mathew Knowles was a businessman, 
                    and her mother Tina Knowles (Lawson) was a hairdresser. Her younger sister, singer-songwriter Solange, was born June 26th, 1986. 
                    Beyoncé’s career in music and dance began as a small child. She was enrolled in dance classes and attended art schools in the Houston area. 
                    She ventured into singing through local talent shows and becoming a part of her school and church choirs.<a href="https://teachrock.org/traceitback/beyonce/" class="button-link"target="_blank"> Check Here for more</a></p>

            <article>
                <p>Her love for singing and performing became more than a hobby in 1992, when Beyoncé, along with her family friend Kelly Rowland and LaTavia Robinson, auditioned for an all-girls R&B group that would eventually become Girl’s Tyme. Girl’s Tyme added three other members for a total of 6, and appeared on the hit television talent show Star Search. The group unfortunately lost Star Search, but their appearance on the show motivated them to work harder. Beyoncé’s father Matthew Knowles began to manage the group, cutting it down to four members, adding LeToya Luckett, and booking them at local gigs around Houston.

She has also credited Anita Baker, Mary J. Blige, Selena, Aaliyah and Madonna as other influences of hers.
